						<p> I come from a little town called Nyeri which is sandwiched between 2 mountains. The beautiful scenery and cool tropical weather makes this place a wonderful habitat for the Big Five among other beautiful animals such as the tree hyrax, white tailed mongoose and elands. I love taking walks and soaking up the rich history and culture the town embodies. It is the home of one of Kenya's bravest freedom fighters, Dedan Kimathi and it ia also the final resting place of Lord Baden Powell, the first Chief Scout of the Worldwide Scouts Movement. </p>

						<p> I am a foodie. I enjoy trying new dishes and enjoying m favourites too such as chapati which is shown in the image on the side. I also enjoy travelling and exploring new places. In high school, I participated in an exchange program with Ouré Kostgymnasium School of Sports and Arts in Vejstrup, Denmark. Some places that are in my bucketlist are London, Paris and Sydney. My most favourite hobby is reading. I love soaking in a good book. My favourite series that I absolutely recommend is the Bridgerton books by Julia Stiles. She is one phenomenal writer.</p>

						<p> I love spending time with friends whether it watching a movie indoors or going to the movie theatre. The picture on the left was taken at a wedding of one of my high school friends. And yes, all these are my friends &#x1F604. I am an introvert but i love talking to people about their interests and passions. This is because i believe there are so many talented individuals and the world deserves to see what they have to offer. </p>
